# GDI Seattle Computer Science Fundementals
### Forked from GDISF Teaching Materials - Algorithms 101

## Course Description

**What's an algorithm?** Besides being the answer to most interview questions, an algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem in programming. 

Google Maps uses an algorithm to calculate driving directions through 3 cities while avoiding highways. Amazon uses an algorithm to figure out exactly what product to recommend to you next so that you'll blindly one-click it. 

In this class, we will discuss what an algorithm is, introduce the idea of algorithmic complexity (big O notation), demonstrate sort and search algorithms (with a hands-on re-enactment), and finish with an overview of the many types of algorithms out there. 

This class focuses on design-thinking for algorithms, which is a pre-requisite to expressing these ideas in code.

### Prerequisites

CS Prerequisites:
* Working knowledge of programming fundamentals, such as working with arrays, loops, and functions, is required. A GDI Intro to Programming class in any language is sufficient.

Math Prerequisites:
* Algebra - As we analyze algorithms, weâ€™ll use algebra to simplify expressions.

### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - we recommend Google Chrome
 - A text editor. We recommend [Atom](http://atom.io)

### Topics covered:
* What is an algorithm?
* Time and space complexity
* Big O notation
* Searching and sorting
* Data structures
